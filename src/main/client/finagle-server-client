An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Mauricio Mena
was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most
methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of
dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men
that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least
conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Mexico,
coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather
more lax than befits a medical man.
